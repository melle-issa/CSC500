# CSC500
This is a repo for all my assignments for the CSC500 Spring C class. It contains the code needed to complete the assignments broken up by which module these assignments are for.

## Critical Thinking Assignment 1
For this assignment, I needed to make a calculator. This task was divided into two parts: one for addition and subtraction and another for multiplication and division

## Critical Thinking Assignment 2
For this assignment, I was asking to make two things. One was a meal price calculator that included additional costs for a tip and sales tax and the other was an alarm time calculator that takes the current hour and desired number of hours until an alarm goes off and outputs the time on a 24-hour clock that the alarm will ring
