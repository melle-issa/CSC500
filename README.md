# CSC500
This is a repo for all my assignments for the CSC500 Spring C class. It contains the code needed to complete the assignments broken up by which module these assignments are for.

## Critical Thinking Assignment 1
For this assignment, I needed to make a calculator. This task was divided into two parts: one for addition and subtraction and another for multiplication and division.<br/>

## Critical Thinking Assignment 2
For this assignment, I was asking to make two things. One was a meal price calculator that included additional costs for a tip and sales tax and the other was an alarm time calculator that takes the current hour and desired number of hours until an alarm goes off and outputs the time on a 24-hour clock that the alarm will ring.<br/>

## Milestone for Module 4
For the milestone assignment, I made an online shopping cart application. I needed to create an ItemToPurchase class in order to store all the items in the user's shopping cart. Then I needed to make a member function that allows us to print out the overall value of that item. The user entered in 2 items for the cart and I needed to print out the list of items in the cart and the total cost of everything to be bought. <br/>

## Critical Thinking Assignment 5
For this CTA, I needed to make a program that asks users for a number of years, and then iterates over all the months of the year for each year and asks about the rainfall for each month. Then at the end, we total the rainfall and find the average for all the months passed. Secondly, I needed to make a program that prompts users to enter the number of books they purchased this month and then output the number of rewards points they received based on that amount. <br/>
